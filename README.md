It lets users rent out their room or apartment that's not being used to a traveler or someone needing a place for short-stay. 

This project is core data base and incorporates StackMob as backend. 
It lets user register for the site and create their log in. 
Once they are logged in, they can upload photos and information of the apartment or room they like to rent out.
